# Mischallaneous commands
Mischallaneous commands I've made that go nowhere else

## Features
- Not much (yet)

## Usage

`-Modmyself` - Actions a random moderation command on the user who triggered the command. Also sends the general info in your DMs and in modlog (won't include images)


`-revive` - Sends an small boring embed that is supposed to revive the chat when dead.


## Other Info
These commands **are** standalone. You are able to use them without each other, it is not required that they are used together. However it will look more organized.

These commands do not feature any images in this Readme since these are misc commands that don't need doucmenting like my others
