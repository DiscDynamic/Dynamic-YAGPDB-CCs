## Other Info
These commands **are** standalone. You are able to use them without each other, it is not required that they're used together.

Please note: The embed thumbnails are standardised for servers with an animated icon.
If your server does not use this. In the `thumbnail` lines of the code replace the "`.gif`" with a "`.png`"
